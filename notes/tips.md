The provided stack trace points to a `ClassCastException` that is occurring during the analysis of your `build.gradle.kts` file.  The specific error is:

```
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.intellij.psi.impl.file.PsiBinaryFileImpl cannot be cast to class com.intellij.psi.impl.source.PsiFileWithStubSupport
```

Let's break down what this means and potential causes and solutions:

**Understanding the Error**

* **`ClassCastException`**: This is a Java error that happens when you try to cast an object of one class to another class that it is *not* compatible with.  The JVM doesn't allow you to force a type change that's fundamentally invalid.

* **`com.intellij.psi.impl.file.PsiBinaryFileImpl`**:  This represents a binary file (like an image, a compiled class file, etc.) within IntelliJ's Project Structure Interface (PSI). PSI is IntelliJ's internal representation of your project's files and code.

* **`com.intellij.psi.impl.source.PsiFileWithStubSupport`**: This represents a source code file that *can* be efficiently indexed using a "stub" index.  Stubs are lightweight representations of the file's structure, used for faster code completion, navigation, and other IDE features.  Kotlin files, Java files, etc., are generally represented this way if possible.

* **The problem**: IntelliJ is encountering a file that it *thinks* should be source code with stub support (that's what the code is trying to cast it to), but it's actually a binary file.  This is unexpected.

**Possible Causes**

1. **Corrupted IntelliJ Index:**  This is the most common cause. IntelliJ maintains an index of your project to speed up operations. If this index becomes corrupted, it can lead to incorrect file classifications.  The IDE might mistakenly believe a file is a Kotlin source file when it's actually a binary.

2. **File Type Association Issues:** The file extension `.kts` is associated with Kotlin script files. If, for some reason, this association is messed up in your IntelliJ settings (or globally in your system), IntelliJ might misinterpret the file type.  This is less likely, but worth checking.

3. **Third-Party Plugin Conflicts:**  A plugin might be interfering with IntelliJ's file type detection or PSI building process.

4. **Problems with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):** Because your project path starts with `//wsl$/Ubuntu/...`, you are using WSL. There can be issues with how IntelliJ interacts with the WSL file system.  Sometimes, file system changes within WSL aren't properly detected by IntelliJ.

5. **Gradle Cache/Build Issues:**  Sometimes, corrupted or outdated files in your Gradle build cache can lead to issues during analysis.

6. **IntelliJ Bug:**  While less likely, it's possible there's a bug in IntelliJ, especially if you're using a very recent or unstable version.

**Solutions**

Here are the steps to try, in order of likelihood and ease of implementation:

1. **Invalidate Caches and Restart IntelliJ:** This is the *first* thing to try. It clears IntelliJ's cached data, including its index, forcing it to rebuild.
   * Go to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart...`
   * Choose "Invalidate and Restart".
   * **Important:**  After restarting, let IntelliJ fully re-index your project. This can take a few minutes, especially for large projects. Don't try to work with the code until indexing is complete.

2. **Clean and Rebuild Gradle Project:**
   * In IntelliJ, use the Gradle tool window (View -> Tool Windows -> Gradle).
   * Run the `clean` task.
   * Then, run the `build` task (or `assemble` if you're building a library).
   * This ensures that your Gradle build is fresh.

3. **Delete the `.idea` directory and `.gradle` directory, and re-import the project.**
    * Close IntelliJ.
    * In your project directory (i.e., the directory containing `build.gradle.kts`), delete the `.idea` directory and the `.gradle` directory.  These contain IntelliJ's project settings and Gradle's cache, respectively.
    * Open IntelliJ and import your project again (File -> Open...).  IntelliJ will recreate the `.idea` directory and re-import the Gradle project.  This is a more aggressive cleanup than invalidating caches.

4. **Check File Type Associations:**
   * Go to `File -> Settings -> Editor -> File Types`.
   * Look for the "Kotlin Script" file type. Make sure that `*.kts` is listed in the "Registered Patterns" section.  If it's missing, add it.
   * Also, check to see if `.kts` is mistakenly associated with any other file type.  If so, remove the association.

5. **Check for Conflicting Plugins:**
   * Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`.
   * Disable any recently installed or suspicious plugins (especially those related to Kotlin, Gradle, or code analysis).
   * Restart IntelliJ. If the problem is gone, re-enable the plugins one by one to identify the culprit.

6. **WSL-Specific Considerations:**
   * **Ensure WSL is Properly Integrated:** Make sure you've installed the IntelliJ plugin "WSL" and that it's enabled.
   * **File System Permissions:** Double-check that the user account under which IntelliJ is running has proper read/write access to the files in your WSL file system.  Sometimes permission issues can cause IntelliJ to misinterpret files.
   * **WSL File System Watcher:** There might be a setting to configure how IntelliJ watches for file system changes in WSL. Research and adjust the settings related to WSL file system watching if problems persist.

7. **Update or Downgrade IntelliJ:**
   * **Update:** If you're using an older version of IntelliJ, update to the latest stable release.
   * **Downgrade:** If you've recently updated IntelliJ and the problem started then, consider downgrading to the previous stable version.  This helps determine if the issue is specific to a new IntelliJ version.

8. **Examine the Code at Line 2, Column 5 of `build.gradle.kts`:**  The error message mentions `(2,5)` in the file.  Open `build.gradle.kts` and carefully inspect the code at that location.  Look for anything unusual, incorrect syntax, or potential type mismatches.  While the stack trace suggests a more general indexing/analysis problem, a code error at that specific location could be triggering it.

**If None of the Above Work**

* **Report a Bug to JetBrains:** If you've tried all the above steps and the problem persists, it's likely a bug in IntelliJ itself or in the Kotlin plugin.  Create a detailed bug report on the JetBrains issue tracker ([https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/)). Include:
    * The full stack trace.
    * Your IntelliJ version.
    * Your Kotlin plugin version.
    * Your Gradle version.
    * The contents of your `build.gradle.kts` file (if possible, create a simplified, reproducible example).
    * A clear description of the steps you took to reproduce the error.
